*Presets

- animation: 

HandBrake's settings for cartoons, anime, and CGI.

- appletv: 

HandBrake's settings for the AppleTV.
Provides a good balance between quality
and file size, and optimizes
performance.

- bedlam: 

HandBrake's settings maxed out for
slowest encoding and highest quality.
Use at your own risk. So slow it's not
just insane...it's a trip to the looney
bin.

- broke: 

HandBrake's preset for people without a
lot of money to waste on hard drives.
Tries to maximize quality for burning to
CDs, so you can party like it's 1999.

- deux_six: 

HandBrake's preset for true high profile
x264 quality. A good balance of quality
and speed, based on community standards
found in the wild. This preset will give
you a much better sense of x264's
capabilities than vanilla main profile.

HandBrake's settings for the Sony
PlayStation 3.

- psp: 

HandBrake's settings for the Sony
PlayStation Portable.

use with QuickTime. It can be slow, so
use it when the Normal preset doesn't
look good enough.

- tv: 

HandBrake's settings for video from
television.
